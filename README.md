# Finding Hooman (Unreal Development)

This is a final-year project for Games and Animation students. We developed our game based on the theme of "smell", and came up with the game of Finding Hooman! In this game, you play as a lost dog trying to find their Hooman by sniffing around the environment, speaking to other dogs and solving puzzles.

Two weeks were spent developing a [prototype in Unity](https://github.com/lizziebriggs/FindingHooman-Unity), and now the team are working on porting the game to Unreal Engine 4 and creating/adding new features and assets!
